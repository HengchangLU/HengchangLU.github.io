      <h2>Basic Info</h2>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Disasters and Vulnerability</p>
      <p><strong>Names:</strong> Barrett Lin, Hengchang Lu</p>
      <p><strong>Email:</strong> b.a.lin@wustl.edu, hengchang@wustl.edu</p>

    <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Barrett:</strong> Natural disasters have always been an interesting concept to me
      as they simply happen with or without human interaction. While I haven't done much
      actual research into the effects they have on place, I can always remember seeing
      horrific details on the news both on the cost of human life as well as disaster relief
      efforts. I remember when I was in high school a snowstorm hit where I lived in Texas,
      and, without the proper infrastructure to handle such cold, people were without clean
      water and electricity for weeks. The key motivation for this project comes from looking
      at how natural disasters have an unequal impact on locations based on their preparedness
      for such disasters, seen through general variables like GDP and population density, as
      well as more specific variables like relevant infrastructure. The hope for this project
      is that it reveals important insights that can be acted on in order to mitigate the costs
      of natural disasters in places affected the most.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary questions we are attempting to answer with our visualization are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How do natural disasters affect countries of different population density, GDP, and
        infrastructure strength?
      </li>
      <li>Are natural disasters a key reason that places might struggle and remain in poverty?</li>
      <li>
        How fast are countries able to bounce back from natural disasters and is this dependent on
        existing infrastructure?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through answering these questions, we want to learn the relationship between natural disasters
      and the aforementioned variables. We want to learn these aspects so that recovery efforts can
      be more targeted, and the places that desperately need help receive it and can develop the
      tools to prevent future disaster. Some benefits that could come from this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Extra government assistance to places heavily affected by natural disasters, either through
        quicker support after the fact or building up infrastructure and wealth prior
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand places of high risk, both in likelihood of natural disasters occurring and
        inability/lack of speed in recovery, encouraging re-location of inhabitants or more safety
        procedures depending
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand how natural disasters can affect financial health of specific locations,
        potentially giving companies insight on building costs/insurance plans
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      We have found a lot of geospatial dataset on kaggle that are useful for our project. The core
      dataset is the global earthquake - tsunami risk assessment dataset
      (<a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmeduzaki/global-earthquake-tsunami-risk-assessment-dataset"
        target="_blank"
        >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmeduzaki/global-earthquake-tsunami-risk-assessment-dataset</a
      >) containing geospatial data for over 100 historical earthquake events from 1900 to 2020 with
      a focus on tsunami generation potential. It includes key features like earthquake magnitude,
      focal depth, and epicenter coordinates. Data quality is especially good for post-1960 events
      due to improved monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world GDP dataset
      (<a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zgrcemta/world-gdpgdp-gdp-per-capita-and-annual-growths"
        target="_blank"
        >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zgrcemta/world-gdpgdp-gdp-per-capita-and-annual-growths</a
      >), based on World Bank data, is included as a core dataset to assess the socioeconomic
      vulnerability of countries to natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. It provides
      annual metrics from 1960 onward. This dataset is crucial because GDP significantly influences
      a country's ability to prepare for, withstand, and recover from severe natural disasters.
      Lower GDP often correlates with weaker infrastructure, limited emergency resources, and high
      casualty rates. We can use this to analyze how economic status shapes disaster impact and
      recovery speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      To enhance our analysis of how earthquakes and tsunamis impact a region's key infrastructure,
      we incorporate more geospatial datasets on critical assets near epicenters or coastlines. This
      allows us to model risks based on proximity. The dataset are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Global aviation hubs</strong>
        (<a
          href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshalhonde/global-aviation-hub-dataset-of-airports-worldwide"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshalhonde/global-aviation-hub-dataset-of-airports-worldwide</a
        >): comprehensive records of airports with identifiers, locations, and elevation, etc.
        Airports near coastlines/epicenters are vital for evacuation/relief but vulnerable to
        tsunamis or earthquake damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World port data</strong>
        (<a
          href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/world-wide-port-index-data"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/world-wide-port-index-data</a
        >): details on world's major harbors/ports. Ports are prime tsunami targets due to the fact
        that waves are amplified in harbors. Disruptions in harbors cascade to trade-dependent
        economies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Global powerplant database</strong>
        (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/global-powerplants" target="_blank"
          >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/global-powerplants</a
        >): facilities across all countries, with capacity and types. Shallow depth earthquakes
        threaten powerplants, and especially endanger hydro dams (flooding/collapse). Low GDP areas
        with vulnerable/aging plants suffer blackouts and health risks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nuclear power plants</strong>
        (<a
          href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liananapalkova/nuclear-power-plants"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liananapalkova/nuclear-power-plants</a
        >): Earthquakes and tsunamis pose severe risks to nuclear facilities, like in 2011 Fukushima
        disaster. It could cause meltdowns and long-term contamination.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      We will first organize key information for our raw data. The global earthquake tsunami dataset
      includes earth magnitude, focal depth, epicenter coordinates, and tsunami generation
      potential. World gdp dataset contains annual metrics like total national/regional GDP, GDP per
      capita, and growth rates. Infrastructure datasets comprise global aviation hubs, world ports,
      powerplants, and nuclear power plants
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to convert all datasets to compatible base formats like GeoJSON. We need to also unify
      the coordinate system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Handle missing values. We need to label missing records in the earthquake-tsunami data before
      1960. For GDP data, we need to address annual missing values in small countries and regions.
      For missing key infrastructure attributes, we can supplement information via official
      databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also need to remove some unreasonable records in the earthquake data. For example,
      micro-earthquakes with magnitude &lt; 2.0 can barely be felt and are excluded from analysis.
      Also we should remove extreme outliers in the GDP data. Should there be sharp annual declines
      or increases caused by wars or pandemics, we want to store them separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then we link scattered datasets by the dimensions of geography and time to form a
      comprehensive dataset usable for visualization. The core correlation logics are: 1. Spatial
      correlation. Based on latitude and longitude, we need to calculate straight line distance
      between airports, ports, powerplants and epicenters to determine if they fall within disaster
      impact zones. We need to also add a temporal correlation link that binds the time at which a
      disaster takes place and the socioeconomic situation of this region at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, we need two fused datasets. One is the disaster-economy table where each row
      includes year, country, earthquake magnitude, tsunami potential, total GDP, and GDP per
      capita. The other one is the disaster-infrastructure table where each row includes year,
      country, disaster type, affected infrastructure type, number of facilities.
    </p>

        <strong>Playable Feature:</strong> The visualization can play (like a time-lapse) of how the
        changes happen over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Earthquake/Tsunami Effect:</strong> Instead of a static point or color scale change,
        locations where these disasters happen could be like red shockwaves coming out (based on
        magnitude) or blue waves crashing into the location for tsunamis
